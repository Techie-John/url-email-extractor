# URL & Email Extractor Bot ðŸ¤–

Quickly extract URLs and email addresses from any text!

**How it works:**
1.  Send an email to `extract@your-subdomain.com` (replace with your actual service email).
2.  Put the text you want to process directly in the **body** of the email. You can also put it in the subject if it's short.
3.  Our automated system will extract all unique URLs and email addresses and email them back to you within minutes.

**Example:**
Send an email with this text:
"Check out my website at www.example.com and drop me a line at info@mysite.org. Also, see this link: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html"

You'll receive an email back with:
-   `www.example.com`
-   `https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html`
-   `info@mysite.org`

**Pricing:**
Currently free for all extractions. Enjoy!
